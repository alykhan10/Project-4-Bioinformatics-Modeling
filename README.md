# Project #5: Machine Learning
# Engineering a Classification Workflow for Tablets to Interpret Stylus Writing

● Extracted aspect ratio of handwriting data after normalizing the timestamp, xy-positions, and pressure of the stylus
● Partitioned input space of predictor variables into a categorical array using thr k-Nearest Neighbor model in MATLAB
● Applied a statistical function on the transformed datastore to make predictions with a mis-classification rate of 0.3%
